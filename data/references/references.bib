Combing translating ribosome affinity purification with RNA-sequencing (TRAP-seq) data with single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data, we identified 24 mouse VMH neuron clusters. Further analysis, including snRNA-seq data from macaque tissue, defined a more tractable VMH parceling scheme consisting of six major genetically and anatomically differentiated VMH neuron classes with good cross-species conservation. In addition to two major ventrolateral classes, we identified three distinct classes of dorsomedial VMH neurons. Consistent with previously suggested unique roles for leptin receptor (Lepr)-expressing VMH neurons, Lepr expression marked a single dorsomedial class. We also identified a class of glutamatergic VMH neurons that resides in the tuberal region, anterolateral to the neuroanatomical core of the VMH. This atlas of conserved VMH neuron populations provides an unbiased starting point for the analysis of VMH circuitry and function.},

  abstract = {Abstract Stress-induced cortical alertness is maintained by a heightened excitability of noradrenergic neurons innervating, notably, the prefrontal cortex. However, neither the signaling axis linking hypothalamic activation to delayed and lasting noradrenergic excitability nor the molecular cascade gating noradrenaline synthesis is defined. Here, we show that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone-releasing neurons innervate ependymal cells of the 3rd ventricle to induce ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) release for transport through the brain's aqueductal system. CNTF binding to its cognate receptors on norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus then initiates sequential phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase with the Ca2+-sensor secretagogin ensuring activity dependence in both rodent and human brains. Both CNTF and secretagogin ablation occlude stress-induced cortical norepinephrine synthesis, ensuing neuronal excitation and behavioral stereotypes. Cumulatively, we identify a multimodal pathway that is rate-limited by CNTF volume transmission and poised to directly convert hypothalamic activation into long-lasting cortical excitability following acute stress.},

Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor and Python package containing computational methods to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of interactions, which are not present in other frameworks. Moreover, it leverages OmniPath, a meta-resource comprising over 100 databases of prior knowledge. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation experiments. Our findings suggest that simple linear models and the consensus score across top methods perform better than other methods at predicting perturbed regulators.

The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F1 score.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: There are a number of well-established methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) for automatically capturing systematic variation due to  latent variables in large-scale genomic data. PCA and related methods may  directly provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable  that is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model. An unsolved problem in  this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are  drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (PCs) (and  other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the  genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance  artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting.  RESULTS: We introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to  accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly  associated with any subset or linear combination of PCs. The proposed method can  greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered in genomics  and can be used to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with  latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains  accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios.  We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the proposed  method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell-cycle  regulated with an accurate measure of statistical significance. We also analyze  gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression data  to provide a molecularly driven phenotype. Using our method, we find a greater  enrichment for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis  that uses a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype. The  proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale quantifications of  systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses.

  abstract = {Prolonged obesity is associated with blunted feeding and thermogenic autonomic responses to leptin, but cardiovascular responses to leptin are maintained. This  state of selective leptin resistance is, therefore, proposed to contribute to the  pathogenesis and maintenance of obesity-associated hypertension. Cells of the  arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus detect leptin, and although the cellular and  molecular mechanisms remain unclear, altered arcuate nucleus biology is hypothesized  to contribute to selective leptin resistance. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat  diet (HFD) or chow from 8 to 18 weeks of age, as this paradigm models selective  leptin resistance. Nuclei were then isolated from arcuate nucleus for single-nucleus  RNA sequencing. HFD caused expected gains in adiposity and circulating leptin.  Twenty-three unique cell-type clusters were identified, and Ingenuity Pathway  Analysis was used to explore changes in gene expression patterns due to chronic HFD  within each cluster. Notably, gene expression signatures related to leptin signaling  exhibited suppression predominantly in neurons identified as the Agouti-related  peptide (Agrp) subtype. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis results were also consistent with  alterations in CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) signaling in Agrp  neurons after HFD, and reduced phosphorylated CREB was confirmed in arcuate nucleus  after prolonged HFD by capillary electrophoresis-based Western blotting. These  findings support the concept that prolonged HFD-induced obesity is associated with  selective changes in Agrp neuron biology, possibly secondary to altered CREB  signaling.},

Many  computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a  resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict  potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of  resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed  light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference  resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods' predictions.  Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of  overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched  proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and  show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions.  Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial  colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that  predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the  use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide LIANA, a  LIgand-receptor ANalysis frAmework as an open-source interface to all the  resources and methods.},

In contrast to  other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of  both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately.

Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and spurious differential gene expression results. Here we develop a deep generative model based on the phenomenology of noise generation in droplet-based assays. The proposed model accurately distinguishes cell-containing droplets from cell-free droplets, learns the background noise profile and provides noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We implement this approach in the scalable and robust open-source software package CellBender. Analysis of simulated data demonstrates that CellBender operates near the theoretically optimal denoising limit. Extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks highlight enhanced concordance between droplet-based single-cell data and established gene expression patterns, while the learned background noise profile provides evidence of degraded or uncaptured cell types.},

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from ``regularized negative binomial regression,'' where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package , with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit .},

Here, we perform single-nuclei RNA sequencing of 40,064 hypothalamic nuclei from young and aged female mice. We identify cell type-specific signatures of aging in neuronal subtypes as well as astrocytes and microglia. We uncover changes in cell types critical for metabolic regulation and body composition and in an area of the hypothalamus linked to cognition. Our analysis also reveals an unexpected female-specific feature of hypothalamic aging: the master regulator of X inactivation, Xist, is elevated with age, particularly in hypothalamic neurons. Moreover, using machine learning, we show that levels of X chromosome genes and Xist itself, can accurately predict cellular age. This study identifies critical cell-specific changes of the aging hypothalamus in mammals and uncovers a potential marker of neuronal aging in females.},

A general and efficient algorithm for fitting a generalized additive model consists of a hierarchy of three modules: scatterplot smoothers, backfitting algorithm, and local-scoring algorithm. These three steps are a rather natural and intuitive generalization of the usual linear model algorithms, and that is how they were originally conceived. The algorithm for fitting a gam is exactly analogous to the algorithm for glms. The chapter presents the S functions for fitting and understanding generalized additive models. In some cases, especially for generalized linear or additive models, adding residuals to a plot is unhelpful because they can distort the scale dramatically. Any interesting features in the functions get lost because of a few large residuals, even though they may carry a very small weight.},

Here, we evaluate both the theoretical basis and practical implementation of the proposed method. The proposed method is highly-conservative, and therefore, unlikely to mischaracterize reads as spliced (mature) or unspliced (nascent) when they are not. However, we find that it leaves a large fraction of reads classified as ambiguous, and, in practice, allocates these ambiguous reads in an all-or-nothing manner, and differently between single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Further, as implemented in practice, the ambiguous classification is implicit and based on the index against which the reads are mapped, which leads to several drawbacks compared to methods that consider both spliced (mature) and unspliced (nascent) mapping targets simultaneously {\textemdash} for example, the ability to use confidently assigned reads to rescue ambiguous reads based on shared UMIs and gene targets. Nonetheless, we show that these conservative assignment rules can be obtained directly in existing approaches simply by altering the set of targets that are indexed. To this end, we introduce the             spliceu             reference and show that its use with             alevin-fry             recapitulates the more conservative proposed classification.                                   We also observe that, on experimental data, and under the proposed allocation rules for ambiguous UMIs, the difference between the proposed classification scheme and existing conventions appears much smaller than previously reported. We demonstrate the use of the new             piscem             index for mapping simultaneously against spliced (mature) and unspliced (nascent) targets, allowing classification against the full nascent and mature transcriptome in human or mouse in {$<$}3GB of memory. Finally, we discuss the potential of incorporating probabilistic evidence into the inference of splicing status, and suggest that it may provide benefits beyond what can be obtained from discrete classification of UMIs as splicing-ambiguous.},

To identify genes that control hypothalamic development, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to profile mouse hypothalamic gene expression across 12 developmental time points between embryonic day 10 and postnatal day 45. This identified genes that delineated clear developmental trajectories for all major hypothalamic cell types, and readily distinguished major regional subdivisions of the developing hypothalamus. By using our developmental dataset, we were able to rapidly annotate previously unidentified clusters from existing scRNA-Seq datasets collected during development and to identify the developmental origins of major neuronal populations of the ventromedial hypothalamus. We further show that our approach can rapidly and comprehensively characterize mutants that have altered hypothalamic patterning, identifying Nkx2.1 as a negative regulator of prethalamic identity. These data serve as a resource for further studies of hypothalamic development, physiology, and dysfunction.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The continued progress in developing technological platforms, availability of many published experimental datasets, as well as different  statistical methods to analyze those data have allowed approaching the same  research question using various methods simultaneously. To get the best out of  all these alternatives, we need to integrate their results in an unbiased manner.  Prioritized gene lists are a common result presentation method in genomic data  analysis applications. Thus, the rank aggregation methods can become a useful and  general solution for the integration task. RESULTS: Standard rank aggregation  methods are often ill-suited for biological settings where the gene lists are  inherently noisy. As a remedy, we propose a novel robust rank aggregation (RRA)  method. Our method detects genes that are ranked consistently better than  expected under null hypothesis of uncorrelated inputs and assigns a significance  score for each gene. The underlying probabilistic model makes the algorithm  parameter free and robust to outliers, noise and errors. Significance scores also  provide a rigorous way to keep only the statistically relevant genes in the final  list. These properties make our approach robust and compelling for many settings.

Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of {\textasciitilde}106 cells on a personal computer.

  abstract = {We present two classes of improved estimators for mutual information M(X,Y), from samples of random points distributed according to some joint probability density {$\mu$}(x,y). In contrast to conventional estimators based on binnings, they are based on entropy estimates from k-nearest neighbor distances. This means that they are data efficient (with k=1 we resolve structures down to the smallest possible scales), adaptive (the resolution is higher where data are more numerous), and have minimal bias. Indeed, the bias of the underlying entropy estimates is mainly due to nonuniformity of the density at the smallest resolved scale, giving typically systematic errors which scale as functions of k/N for N points. Numerically, we find that both families become exact for independent distributions, i.e. the estimator {\textasciicircum}M(X,Y) vanishes (up to statistical fluctuations) if {$\mu$}(x,y)={$\mu$}(x){$\mu$}(y). This holds for all tested marginal distributions and for all dimensions of x and y. In addition, we give estimators for redundancies between more than two random variables. We compare our algorithms in detail with existing algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our estimators for assessing the actual independence of components obtained from independent component analysis (ICA), for improving ICA, and for estimating the reliability of blind source separation., This article appears in the following collections:},

To accurately model these data in downstream analyses, previous work has shown that droplet-based scRNA-seq data are not zero-inflated, but whether droplet-based snRNA-seq data follow the same probability distributions has not been systematically evaluated. Using pseudo-negative control data from nuclei in mouse cortex sequenced with the 10x Genomics Chromium system, we found that snRNA-seq data follow a negative binomial distribution, suggesting that parametric statistical models applied to scRNA-seq are transferable to snRNA-seq. Furthermore, we found that the quantification choices in adapting quantification mapping strategies from scRNA-seq to snRNA-seq can play a significant role in downstream analyses and biological interpretation. In particular, reference transcriptomes that do not include intronic regions result in significantly smaller library sizes and incongruous cell type classifications. We also confirmed the presence of a gene length bias in snRNA-seq data, which we show is present in both exonic and intronic reads, and investigate potential causes for the bias.},

A complete understanding of this process requires a systematic characterization of cell states over the entire spatiotemporal range of brain development. The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1-8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data includes normalization by sequencing depth to remove this technical variability, and  nonlinear transformation to stabilize the variance across genes with different  expression levels. Instead, two recent papers propose to use statistical count  models for these tasks: Hafemeister and Satija (Genome Biol 20:296, 2019)  recommend using Pearson residuals from negative binomial regression, while Townes  et al. (Genome Biol 20:295, 2019) recommend fitting a generalized PCA model.  Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and  empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing. RESULTS: We show  that the model of Hafemeister and Satija produces noisy parameter estimates  because it is overspecified, which is why the original paper employs post hoc  smoothing. When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution  equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. Further, our analysis  indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija are  biased, and that the data are in fact consistent with the overdispersion  parameter being independent of gene expression. We then use negative control data  without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI  counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data  are close to Poisson and suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we  perform a benchmark to compare the performance of Pearson residuals,  variance-stabilizing transformations, and GLM-PCA on scRNA-seq datasets with  known ground truth. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that analytic Pearson residuals  strongly outperform other methods for identifying biologically variable genes,  and capture more of the biologically meaningful variation when used for  dimensionality reduction.},

To investigate how this diversity is generated, here we used  single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of mouse cells collected  along a developmental time course. Heterogeneity within mitotic progenitors in  the ganglionic eminences is driven by a highly conserved maturation trajectory,  alongside eminence-specific transcription factor expression that seeds the  emergence of later diversity. Upon becoming postmitotic, progenitors diverge and  differentiate into transcriptionally distinct states, including an interneuron  precursor state. By integrating datasets across developmental time points, we  identified shared sources of transcriptomic heterogeneity between adult  interneurons and their precursors, and uncovered the embryonic emergence of  cardinal interneuron subtypes. Our analysis revealed that the transcription  factor Mef2c, which is linked to various neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental  disorders, delineates early precursors of parvalbumin-expressing neurons, and is  essential for their development. These findings shed new light on the molecular  diversification of early inhibitory precursors, and identify gene modules that  may influence the specification of human interneuron subtypes.},

A prominent  problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected  groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of  network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of  arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks  coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in  other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general  setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links  (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.},

Here we present den-SNE and densMAP, which are  density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and  demonstrate their ability to accurately incorporate information about transcriptomic  variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data.  Applied to recently published datasets, our methods reveal significant changes in  transcriptomic variability in a range of biological processes, including  heterogeneity in transcriptomic variability of immune cells in blood and tumor,  human immune cell specialization and the developmental trajectory of Caenorhabditis  elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in  other scientific domains.},

Implementation of these methods requires a choice of resolution parameter to  determine the number of clusters, and critical judgment from the researchers is  required to determine the desired resolution. This supervised process takes  significant time and effort. Moreover, it can be difficult to compare and  characterize the evolution of cell clusters from results obtained at one single  resolution. To overcome these challenges, we built Multi-resolution Reconciled  Tree (MRtree), a highly flexible tree-construction algorithm that generates a  cluster hierarchy from flat clustering results attained for a range of  resolutions. Because MRtree can be coupled with most scRNA-seq clustering  algorithms, it inherits the robustness and versatility of a flat clustering  approach, while maintaining the hierarchical structure of cells. The constructed  trees from multiple scRNA-seq datasets effectively reflect the extent of  transcriptional distinctions among cell groups and align well with levels of  functional specializations among cells. Importantly, application to fetal brain  cells identified subtypes of cells determined mainly by maturation states,  spatial location and terminal specification.},

Here we outline a common problem with 3' scRNA-seq datasets where genes that have been documented to be expressed with other methods, are either completely missing or are dramatically under-represented thereby compromising the discovery of cell types, states, and genetic mechanisms. We show that this problem stems from three main sources of sequencing read loss: (1) reads mapping immediately 3' to known gene boundaries due to poor 3' UTR annotation; (2) intronic reads stemming from unannotated exons or pre-mRNA; (3) discarded reads due to gene overlaps             3             . Each of these issues impacts the detection of thousands of genes even in well-characterized mouse and human genomes rendering downstream analysis either partially or fully blind to their expression. We outline a simple three-step solution to recover the missing gene expression data that entails compiling a hybrid pre-mRNA reference to retrieve intronic reads             4             , resolving gene collision derived read loss through removal of readthrough and premature start transcripts, and redefining 3' gene boundaries to capture false intergenic reads. We demonstrate with mouse brain and human peripheral blood datasets that this approach dramatically increases the amount of sequencing data included in downstream analysis revealing 20 - 50\% more genes per cell and incorporates 15-20\% more sequencing reads than with standard solutions             5             . These improvements reveal previously missing biologically relevant cell types, states, and marker genes in the mouse brain and human blood profiling data. Finally, we provide scRNA-seq optimized transcriptomic references for human and mouse data as well as simple algorithmic implementation of these solutions that can be deployed to both thoroughly as well as poorly annotated genomes. Our results demonstrate that optimizing the sequencing read mapping step can significantly improve the analysis resolution as well as biological insight from scRNA-seq. Moreover, this approach warrants a fresh look at preceding analyses of this popular and scalable cellular profiling technology.},

Yet, the prevalence, molecular mechanisms and genetic control of local gene co-expression are far from being understood. Here, by leveraging gene expression measurements across 49 human tissues and hundreds of individuals, we find that local gene co-expression occurs in 13\% to 53\% of genes per tissue. By integrating various molecular assays (e.g. ChIP-seq and Hi-C), we estimate the ability of several mechanisms, such as enhancer-gene interactions, in distinguishing gene pairs that are co-expressed from those that are not. Notably, we identify 32,636 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) which associate with co-expressed gene pairs and often overlap enhancer regions. Due to affecting several genes, these eQTLs are more often associated with multiple human traits than other eQTLs. Our study paves the way to comprehend trait pleiotropy and functional interpretation of QTL and GWAS findings. All local gene co-expression identified here is available through a public database (               https://glcoex.unil.ch/               ).},

Nevertheless, we lack a developmental blueprint that integrates the molecular determinants of neuronal and glial diversity along temporal and spatial scales of hypothalamus development3. Here we combine single-cell RNA sequencing of 51,199 mouse cells of ectodermal origin, gene regulatory network (GRN) screens in conjunction with genome-wide association study-based disease phenotyping, and genetic lineage reconstruction to show that nine glial and thirty-three neuronal subtypes are generated by mid-gestation under the control of distinct GRNs. Combinatorial molecular codes that arise from neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and transcription factors are minimally required to decode the taxonomical hierarchy of hypothalamic neurons. The differentiation of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine neurons, but not glutamate neurons, relies on quasi-stable intermediate states, with a pool of GABA progenitors giving rise to dopamine cells4. We found an unexpected abundance of chemotropic proliferation and guidance cues that are commonly implicated in dorsal (cortical) patterning5 in the hypothalamus. In particular, loss of SLIT{\textendash}ROBO signalling impaired both the production and positioning of periventricular dopamine neurons. Overall, we identify molecular principles that shape the developmental architecture of the hypothalamus and show how neuronal heterogeneity is transformed into a multimodal neural unit to provide virtually infinite adaptive potential throughout life.},

Consequently, a large number of computational methods for extracting dynamic  information from such data have been developed. One example is RNA velocity  analysis, in which spliced and unspliced RNA abundances are jointly modeled in order  to infer a 'direction of change' and thereby a future state for each cell in the  gene expression space. Naturally, the accuracy and interpretability of the inferred  RNA velocities depend crucially on the correctness of the estimated abundances.  Here, we systematically compare five widely used quantification tools, in total  yielding thirteen different quantification approaches, in terms of their estimates  of spliced and unspliced RNA abundances in five experimental droplet scRNA-seq data  sets. We show that there are substantial differences between the quantifications  obtained from different tools, and identify typical genes for which such  discrepancies are observed. We further show that these abundance differences  propagate to the downstream analysis, and can have a large effect on estimated  velocities as well as the biological interpretation. Our results highlight that  abundance quantification is a crucial aspect of the RNA velocity analysis workflow,  and that both the definition of the genomic features of interest and the  quantification algorithm itself require careful consideration.},

  abstract = {Hypothalamic feeding circuits have been identified as having innate synaptic plasticity, mediating adaption to the changing metabolic milieu by controlling  responses to feeding and obesity. However, less is known about the regulatory  principles underlying the dynamic changes in agouti-related protein (AgRP)  perikarya, a region crucial for gating of neural excitation and, hence, feeding.  Here we show that AgRP neurons activated by food deprivation, ghrelin  administration, or chemogenetics decreased their own inhibitory tone while  triggering mitochondrial adaptations in neighboring astrocytes. We found that it was  the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA released by AgRP neurons that evoked this  astrocytic response; this in turn resulted in increased glial ensheetment of AgRP  perikarya by glial processes and increased excitability of AgRP neurons. We also  identified astrocyte-derived prostaglandin E2, which directly activated - via EP2  receptors - AgRP neurons. Taken together, these observations unmasked a  feed-forward, self-exciting loop in AgRP neuronal control mediated by astrocytes, a  mechanism directly relevant for hunger, feeding, and overfeeding.},

  abstract = {Dimension reduction (DR) techniques such as t-SNE, UMAP, and TriMap have demonstrated impressive visualization performance on many real-world datasets. One tension that has always faced these methods is the trade-off between preservation of global structure and preservation of local structure: these methods can either handle one or the other, but not both. In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the low-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important. We leverage these insights to design a new algorithm for DR, called Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP), which preserves both local and global structure. Our work provides several unexpected insights into what design choices both to make and avoid when constructing DR algorithms.},

We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the basic cell types in the mouse SCN and to characterize their circadian and light-induced gene expression patterns. We identified eight major cell types, with each type displaying a specific pattern of circadian gene expression. Five SCN neuronal subtypes, each with specific combinations of markers, differ in their spatial distribution, circadian rhythmicity and light responsiveness. Through a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse SCN at single-cell resolution, we obtained a standardized SCN atlas containing the spatial distribution of these subtypes and gene expression. Furthermore, we observed heterogeneous circadian gene expression between SCN neuron subtypes. Such a spatiotemporal pattern of gene regulation within the SCN may have an important function in the circadian pacemaker.},

Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets  (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis  and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert  knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a  nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test  Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets.

  abstract = {Clustering techniques are widely used in the analysis of large datasets to group together samples with similar properties. For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA-sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering, and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a dataset is often unknown, and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution, we present clustering trees. This visualization shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions, allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset. Clustering trees can be produced using the clustree R package, available from CRAN and developed on GitHub.},

Here, we used RNA sequencing of  half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse  nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical,  data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by  developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and  neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity,  synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered  seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental  boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine  neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity  followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid  foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous  system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.},
